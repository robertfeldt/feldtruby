* Add Pareto front calculations and saving by the stats logger and/or in collab with the Objective!? 
  - In one way it is easier for the Objective to keep track of these things since it already saves the global mins and maxs.
  - OTOH it may be more logical that the optimizer or the stats object keeps track of this.

* Consider if the quality of the candidate vectors should be be attached to them instead of being handled separately. 
  - We can add instance vars to any Ruby object with "special tricks"... ;)
