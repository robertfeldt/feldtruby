=========

Robert Feldt&#39;s Common Ruby Code lib. I will gradually collect the many generally useful Ruby tidbits I have laying around and clean them up into here. Don't want to rewrite these things again and again...

Time
----
* Time.timestamp()    - Get a timestamp string back with the current time

Array
-----
* [1,2].sum   - sum of elements
* [1,2].mean  - mean/average
* [1,2].stdev - standard deviation

file
----
* file_change_watcher - Watches for file changes and has callbacks hooks for when there are changes
