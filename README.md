=========

Robert Feldt&#39;s Common Ruby Code lib. I will gradually collect the many generally useful Ruby tidbits I have laying around and clean them up into here. Don't want to rewrite these things again and again...

* file
	* file_change_watcher - Watches for file changes and has callbacks hooks for when there are changes

* time - Additions to Time
